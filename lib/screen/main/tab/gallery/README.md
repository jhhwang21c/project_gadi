## Gallery
Shows the grid view of the "starred" or favorite artworks (f_gallery.dart), and each artwork is shown as a clickable card components (c_favoriteCard.dart) that would bring up artwork details upon being clicked. It is basically a short cut to access those artworks.
The page gets automatically updated whenever user toggles "star" or favorite.

## AR
Upon clicking the AR icon, user will be navigated to AR rendering page (f_ar.dart), which renders real-life size rendering of an artwork.
AR rendering is created by google ar core, thus it is only supported in android phones.
